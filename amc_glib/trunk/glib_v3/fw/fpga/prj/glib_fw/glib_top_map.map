NOTE:
The above detailed report is the initial placement of the logic after the clock region assignment. The final placement
may be significantly different because of the various optimization steps which will follow. Specifically, logic blocks
maybe moved to adjacent clock-regions as long as the "number of clocks per region" constraint is not violated.

WARNING:Place:914 - Local congestion has been detected at location SLICE_X61Y166. There is a limitation that if the CI
   or BI pin in a CLB is used, the DX/CX or AX/BX pin respectively cannot be driven by a BUFG. This will lead to an
   unroutable situation.  Please set environment variable XIL_PAR_ENABLE_CHKCIBIPINS to 1 and re-run placer.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
