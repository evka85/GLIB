NOTE:
The above detailed report is the initial placement of the logic after the clock region assignment. The final placement
may be significantly different because of the various optimization steps which will follow. Specifically, logic blocks
maybe moved to adjacent clock-regions as long as the "number of clocks per region" constraint is not violated.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
